# apriori
Contains code for working with apriori algorithm

## the main file to look for is
1. amazon_apriori_revisited.R  : this is the file that works with mygann amazon transactions to find the frequently bought together products
2. amazontransactionsworking.sql : this is the datbase that is being used

3. the php code uses the old analysis..but the concept is basically to list the products in a table after the rules have been found from the R code
